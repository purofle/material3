 * / behavior of this card in different states. Cards with null interaction source will not react to
 * interactions.
 * @param shape Defines the card's shape.
 * @param containerColor The container color of the card.
 * @param contentColor The preferred content color provided by this card to its children.
 * Defaults to either the matching content color for [containerColor], or if [containerColor]

 * @param border [BorderStroke] to draw on top of the card.
 * @param elevation [CardElevation] used to resolve the elevation for this card when the
 * [interactionSource] emits its states. The resolved values control the size of the shadow below
 * the card, as well as its tonal elevation. When [containerColor] is [ColorScheme.surface], a
